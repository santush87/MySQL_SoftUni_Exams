  <p>The online_stores’s Database needs to hold information about products, customers, orders, categories, brands, reviews.</p>
   <p>Your task is to create a database called online_store. Then you will have to create several tables.</p>

        <p>o	Each product has a brand, review and category.</p>
          <p>•	customers – contains information about the customers.</p>
            <p>•	orders – contains information about the orders.</p>
              <p>o	Each order has a customer. </p>
                <p>•	orders_products – a many to many mapping table between the orders and the products.</p>        
    <h2>Section 1: Data Definition Language (DDL) – 40 pts</h2>    
    <p>Make sure you implement the whole database correctly on your local machine, so that you could work with it.</p>
     <p>The instructions you'll be given will be the minimal needed for you to implement the database.</p>
     <h3>01.	Table Design</h3>
      <p>You have been tasked to create the tables in the database by the following models:</p>

 <p>Submit your solutions in Judge on the first task. Submit all SQL table creation statements.</p>
        <p>You will also be given a data.sql file. It will contain a dataset with random data which you will need to store in your local database. This data will be given to you so you will not have to think of data and lose essential time in the process. The data is in the form of INSERT statement queries. </p>
    
<h3>2.	Insert</h3>
    <p>You will have to insert records of data into the coaches table, based on the players table. </p>
     <p>For players with age over 45 (inclusive), insert data in the coaches table with the following values:</p>
      <p>•	first_name – set it to first name of the player</p>
       <p>•	last_name – set it to last name of the player.</p>
        <p>•	salary – set it to double as player’s salary. </p>
    <p>•	coach_level – set it to be equals to count of the characters in player’s first_name.</p>
